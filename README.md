# NoteSpace
NoteSpace follows the philosophy of only doing as much as it needs to. If a feature is not necessary for the bare functionality of 'notetaking', it is not added.

## What is a notetaking application?
A Notetaking application is more focused than a text editor. Instead of the broad goal of making editing any plain text document a pleasant experience, a notetaking application wants to be exceptionally good at editing *note* documents.

These documents are markdown documents automatically rendered when viewed, and stored for the user as plaintext markdown on disk. 

## What does this mean for me?
NoteSpace is an exceptional tool for those who need to write things down in a clean and user friendly way.
